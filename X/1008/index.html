    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

    <h3>June 2, 2012</h3>
    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>protein bar Just the essentials.</li>
            As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
